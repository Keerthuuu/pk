         my passion is to become web develepre.my long time goal is to become web develper i working and learning hard to become a web
         developer i am sure and confident in that deffinetly i will become a great website develper ther is a huge differnce between develeper
         and graet develper if you want to become master on particular skill then you want to learn hard and practice hard to acheive that stage
         "practice makes a man perfect" its raelly true .my advice for you to suuced in your life is that practice more and more to develepery
         yourself and also shine your knwoledge.so work hard learn day by day just learn atlest what is whwt its enough when commparing to
         dont know anything.in fist year of my college eventhogh i dont know how to ask a simple quetion and doubt to my faculty members
         i learning to code faste in udemy which is great plateform to learn code as a programmer i used nearly 6 to 7 hours to code in my first
         yaer of my college life but now i am spending just two hours because its realy easy to me to complete work its enough for me .to create
         a average website iused just two hours this all done because of my practice hardword i know hardwork never fails.when i was a school
         student i dont know anything about coding eventhough i not though in future i will become a graet web developer and comunicate with
         different kind of people .english is just a language its not that much hard to learn becuse i learned it from my fisrt  year of my
         college so dont bather about poeple are mocking u dont bather about wjat they speaking about you
